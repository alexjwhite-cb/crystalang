# crystal-lang

## Introduction

Crystal is a dynamically-typed interpretted object-_orchestration_ language inspired by Go, PHP, and Python.

### Language Objectives

* [ ] Crystal uses a common entrypoint; `main` will always be used to initialise a program.
* [ ] Inheritence is "shallow". Object-types can be defined and their default methods defined and implemented, however one object-type cannot inherit from another. They must be orchestrated together.
* [ ] Attributes and child methods are accessed via `.` syntax
* [ ] Values are piped into and out of functions with the "spoon" syntax: `()->`
